### New Tag Requirements
- **Must have a clear, helpful, and distinctive usage. Tags that can be scraped from somewhere are considered more helpful.**

New tags must have a clear, helpful, and distinctive usage for them to be eligible for creation. In other words, if your proposed tag is considered too vague, too niche, or too similar to other tags, it will be rejected by the voters. This of course is very subjective, but nearly everything involving tags will be subjective. New tags will also be considered more helpful if they can be [scraped from a studio source]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/tags/getting-started-tags/#scraped-vs-manual-tags) already covered on StashDB. So be sure to [check for duplicate tags first](#check-for-duplicate-tags) and make your case to the voters in your [edit comment]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/tags/getting-started-tags/#tag-edit-comments). [Adding a category]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/tags/getting-started-tags/#assigning-tag-categories) wouldn't hurt either.

### Check for Duplicate Tags
- **Search StashDB for similar terms, check tag descriptions and aliases to avoid overlap.**

Tags that are considered too similar to existing tags on StashDB will be rejected. Be sure to search [StashDB's tag list](https://stashdb.org/tags) for similar terms and check tag descriptions to see how they compare to the intended usage of your new tag. Some crossover between tags is allowed, but tags require helpful distinctions between them. Also make sure your new tag's primary name and any aliases you've attached to it are not already used by another tag as an alias. Conflicting aliases will cause your submission to fail, even if it is approved by the voters. StashDB's [tag search](https://stashdb.org/tags) considers aliases, so they shouldn't be too hard to spot.
