### Preferred Performer Names
- **Prefer unique names over commonly used aliases, but otherwise no hard rules only suggestions.**

There are no hard guidelines for choosing primary performer names at this time. However, more unique aliases are almost always preferred over common single word names like "Lola" or "Tony". The following should also be taken into consideration: most frequently used alias, most famous/popular alias, most commonly used name on other databases like IAFD, and alias currently/recently preferred by the performer (often determined by social media profiles).

Also be aware that names are only eligible to be primary names if they've been used as an official adult credit, following the same requirements as [eligible performer aliases](#eligible-performer-aliases).

_Unconfirmed guideline, subject to change pending formal approval._

### Eligible Performer Aliases
- **Must have be used as an official adult credit, no legal names allowed except when a stage name is also their given name.**

Performer aliases must be names that have been used as official credits in an adult video performance. They do not have to be names used as performance aliases in a scene already listed on StashDB. This means that names that have been used professionally in non-adult mainstream performances, listed in credits or bylines as a writer or author, used on public social media accounts, or listed in news articles are not eligible to be listed on StashDB unless they've also been used as an official adult credit.

This also means that outside of the rare occasion of someone regularly using their given name instead of a stage name, **legal names are not allowed anywhere on StashDB**.

_Unconfirmed guideline, subject to change pending formal approval._

### Disambiguation Formatting
