### Full DVD Entries
- **Full movies only allowed for JAV releases or western releases available directly from official studio websites.**

Scene entries that represent full movies are only accepted in limited circumstances. Full movies that only have retailers (Adult DVD Empire, Hot Movies, etc.) or databases (IAFD, Data18, etc.) as their source will not be accepted. JAV movies have been granted an exception for now since they come almost exclusively as full movie downloads instead of split scenes. Exceptions may be granted for full movies that have an official studio website as its source that provides downloads of the full movie as a single file, but this is not guaranteed. We still ask that you hold off until further software developments can be made to better support movies in StashDB.

_Unconfirmed guideline, subject to change pending formal approval._
