### Preferred Scene Dates
- **Earliest known release date, or closest approximate date.**

The earliest known release date for a scene is always the preferred scene date. Production dates should not be used for this field. For [remasters/redistributions/re-releases]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/scenes/adding-scenes/#remasters-redistributions-and-re-releases), the earliest release date refers to that particular release and not the original scene. Approximate dates may be accepted if no exact release date can be sourced or verified. Stash-Box will allow you to omit the day or month in these situations.

_Unconfirmed guideline, subject to change pending formal approval._
