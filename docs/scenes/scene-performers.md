### Missing Scene Performers
- **Must include performers listed anywhere on linked webpages, including descriptions.**

All active performers listed in the details, title, URL, or a linked webpage should be included when adding or editing a scene. This includes male performers in straight scenes. Please note in your edit comment why any performers are not included in your submission. Finding names for missing performers on recommended databases (IAFD, Data18, etc.) is greatly encouraged, but often not required.

_Unconfirmed guideline, subject to change pending formal approval._

### Ambiguous Scene Performers
- **Must avoid ambiguous performer entries, creating new disambiguated entries when necessary.**

[Ambiguous performers]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/performers/getting-started-performers/#handling-ambiguous-performers) should not be added to a scene entry. You should always try to find a properly disambiguated performer entry for your scene. If no entry exists yet for your performer, you will need to create one.

_Unconfirmed guideline, subject to change pending formal approval._

### Preferred Scene Aliases
- **Should be the name officially credited to the performer at the time of release.**

The scene alias can be entered into the field immediately to the right of the performer in the scene edit form. This should be used for whatever name was used as the performer's official credit at the time of release from the original source. It should not be used for character names unless it also serves as the performer's official credit. To be clear, contributors aren't expected to consult the Wayback Machine to verify every single scene alias in their submissions. Whatever the studio link currently lists is usually a reliable default, but editors should try to use the correct name for this field when there's a discrepancy in the description, on the scene cover, in IAFD credits, etc.
