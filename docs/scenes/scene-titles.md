### Preferred Scene Titles
- **Original official scene titles are preferred.**

Original scene titles provided by the official studio website are always the preferred scene title. Scene titles that have been modified by the studio after its original release should not be used as the scene title on StashDB.

_Unconfirmed guideline, subject to change pending formal approval._

### Preferred Title Language
- **English titles are preferred when provided by official website.**

Some studios offer multiple language options on their official website. In these situations, the English versions of scene titles and descriptions are preferred for StashDB. If there is no official English translation available, the next best option is the original language.
