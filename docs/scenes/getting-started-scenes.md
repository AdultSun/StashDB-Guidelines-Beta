# **Getting Started: Scenes**
{: .no_toc }
The following sections are general advice and explanations for potentially confusing aspects in our database for scenes. Because they don't represent explicit decisions concerning database management or curation, they do not require [formal approval]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/getting-started-stashdb/#guideline-proposals).

### Check Duplicate Scenes
- **Search using keywords, filters, and PHashes.**

Before submitting a scene to StashDB, always check for duplicates first. Duplicates will [likely be rejected or removed]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/scenes/adding-scenes/#duplicate-scenes). If you couldn't find a match through Stash's [Scene Tagger]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/getting-started-stashdb/#using-stashdb), the easiest way to check is to rely on [PHash]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/getting-started-stashdb/#whats-a-phash) detection when [submitting a draft]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/getting-started-stashdb/#using-stashdb) to StashDB. Your draft edit will have a warning sign (⚠) at the top if your PHash matches existing scenes in the database. These are not always duplicate scenes and may be due to someone [submitting incorrect fingerprints]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/getting-started-stashdb/#backlog-spreadsheet). Duplicates may also be found by searching for the title on StashDB or by filtering by studio on a performer's page. Also be aware that even if your scene isn't on StashDB yet, someone could have a pending edit to create the same scene. Best way to check for this is to click the favorite star (⭐) on the relevant studio or performer in your submission and [filter for favorites in pending scene creations](https://stashdb.org/edits?favorite=true&operation=create&status=pending&type=scene) on the Edits page.

### Check Scene Performers
- **Find missing performers and avoid ambiguous entries.**

When submitting a new scene, make sure that you are not [missing any performers]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/scenes/scene-performers/#missing-scene-performers). If they are listed on the studio page, in the title, or in the description, you will be expected to include them in your submission. Also make sure that none of your included performers link to [ambiguous performer entries]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/performers/getting-started-performers/#handling-ambiguous-performers). These are most often single-name performers with nothing in their disambiguation field. Both of these may put your scene creation at risk of being rejected.

### Scene Edit Comments
- **Say what you're doing, why you're doing it, and what your sources are.**

Regardless of what kind of edit you're submitting, always include in the comment field what you are doing and why. Bigger or more drastic changes will likely require longer comments, but simple changes likely won't need much. Also please remember to note what you are using as the source of your edit when appropriate. These notes will be helpful when considering further edits in addition to justifying your actions now to those who will be voting on it.
