### Preferred Scene Descriptions
- **Original official descriptions are preferred.**

Original descriptions provided by the official studio website are always the preferred scene description. Descriptions that have been modified by the studio after its original release should not be used in the details field on StashDB. If the studio does not have a unique description for the scene, the details field should be left blank. Auto-generated placeholder descriptions provided by the studio (sometimes referred to as "boilerplate" descriptions) are not considered unique and should not be included. Descriptions provided by a source other than the official studio should also not be included.

_Unconfirmed guideline, subject to change pending formal approval._

### Correcting Scene Descriptions
- **Descriptions should be unaltered from the original studio source in spelling, capitalization, grammar, and punctuation.**

Even when the studio description has obvious grammatical or typographical errors, it should be preserved as it originally appeared. This includes misspellings, incorrect punctuation, odd capitalization, etc. However, exceptions can be made for obvious technical errors introduced by a bad scrape or website update. This includes encoding errors on special characters, obvious glitches with whitespace, visible HTML tags instead of line breaks, etc.

_Unconfirmed guideline, subject to change pending formal approval._

### Preferred Description Language
- **English description are preferred when provided by official website.**

Some studios offer multiple language options on their official website. In these situations, the English versions of scene titles and descriptions are preferred for StashDB. If there is no official English translation available, the next best option is the original language.
