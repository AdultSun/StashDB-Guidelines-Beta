# **Tags: Overview**
{: .no_toc }

This page is an [overview]({{ site.baseurl }}/#category-overviews) for tags on StashDB **containing short summaries only**. More detailed information can be found with the "Quick Links" list above or the navigation tree on the left. Clicking the heading above each summary will also take you to the full version of the relevant section.

The [Getting Started: Tags](getting-started-tags) section covers all subjects relating to scenes, but is limited to advice and explanations. Firm guidelines that you are expected to follow are found in the categories further below. These cover more specific situations within each subject than the [Getting Started sections]({{ site.baseurl }}/#getting-started-pages). Breaking them may risk rejected submissions. If you still have any questions, feel free to ask in **#stashdb-general** or **#ministry-of-truth** on [Discord]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/getting-started-stashdb/#joining-our-discord).

## **[Getting Started: Tags](getting-started-tags)**
The following sections are general advice and explanations for potentially confusing aspects in our database for tags. Because they don't represent explicit decisions concerning database management or curation, they do not require [formal approval]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/getting-started-stashdb/#guideline-proposals).

### [Picking Tags for a Scene](getting-started-tags#picking-tags-for-a-scene)
  - **Start small with "important" tags first, expand as you get more familiar with StashDB's list.**

### [Tag Edit Comments](getting-started-tags#tag-edit-comments)
  - **Say what you're doing, why you're doing it, and what your sources are.**

### [Read Tag Edit Histories](getting-started-tags#read-tag-edit-histories)
  - **Comments in the "Edits" tab will often explain why a tag is organized a certain way, so check it first before making an edit.**

### [Check Tag Usage](getting-started-tags#check-tag-usage)
  - **Look at the scenes underneath a tag to get an idea of its current usage before submitting a destructive edit or description change.**

### [Scraped vs. Manual Tags](getting-started-tags#scraped-vs-manual-tags)
  - **Most tags attached to scenes were scraped from studio sources, not manually added by editors.**

### [Sorted vs. Unsorted Tags](getting-started-tags#sorted-vs-unsorted-tags)
  - **Tags without categories and/or descriptions are considered "unsorted" and should generally be avoided when manually adding tags to scenes.**

### [Merging and Destroying Tags](getting-started-tags#merging-and-destroying-tags)
  - **Unsorted tags that do not have a unique and helpful meaning are candidates for merging/deleting.**

### [Tag Merge Targets](getting-started-tags#tag-merge-targets)
  - **Click "Merge" on the page of the tag you want to keep, then select any tags that should be removed and merged.**

### [Destroying Tags](getting-started-tags#destroying-tags)
  - **Rarely appropriate, usually there's a potential merge that would be preferred.**

### [Adding Tag Aliases](getting-started-tags#adding-tag-aliases)
  - **Make sure there aren't any other tags that would be a better fit for an alias, or that another tag isn't using it already.**

### [Changing a Tag's Primary Name](getting-started-tags#changing-a-tags-primary-name)
  - **Prioritize brevity, clarity, familiarity, and consistency.**

### [Assigning Tag Categories](getting-started-tags#assigning-tag-categories)
  - **If the tag you're editing doesn't have a category yet, add one yourself even if you have to guess to mark it as "sorted".**
