# StashDB Contribution Guidelines
{: .no_toc }
**Welcome to the new StashDB Guidelines Wiki!**

The Google Doc has been deprecated and will see no further updates. This Wiki should be considered your primary resource moving forward. It is very much a work in progress at this time so watch for significant updates in the coming days. Feel free to contact **@AdultSun** on Discord with any suggestions to improve this Wiki.

## **Category Overviews**
Most of the guidelines will be organized under [Performers]({% link docs/performers.md %}), [Scenes]({% link docs/scenes.md %}), [Studios]({% link docs/studios.md %}), and [Tags]({% link docs/tags.md %}). These parent pages serve as overviews that summarize the entire category. More detailed sections can be found in additional pages underneath the category. All of these can also be found on the left side of this webpage.

- [Performers]({% link docs/performers.md %})
- [Scenes]({% link docs/scenes.md %})
- [Studios]({% link docs/studios.md %})
- [Tags]({% link docs/tags.md %})

## **Getting Started Pages**
The following **Getting Started** sections are general advice and explanations for potentially confusing aspects in our database. Because they don't represent explicit decisions concerning database management or curation, they do not require formal approval. **Getting Started** pages specific to [Performers]({% link docs/performers/getting-started-performers.md %}), [Scenes]({% link docs/scenes/getting-started-scenes.md %}), [Studios]({% link docs/studios/getting-started-studios.md %}), and [Tags]({% link docs/tags/getting-started-tags.md %}) can also be found under their respective categories in the navigation tree to the left.

- [Getting Started: Performers]({% link docs/performers/getting-started-performers.md %})
- [Getting Started: Scenes]({% link docs/scenes/getting-started-scenes.md %})
- [Getting Started: Studios]({% link docs/studios/getting-started-studios.md %})
- [Getting Started: Tags]({% link docs/tags/getting-started-tags.md %})
