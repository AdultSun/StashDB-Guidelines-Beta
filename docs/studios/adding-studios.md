### Banned Studios
- **No studios that repeatedly violate the consent of performers, including "Girls Do Porn" and its spin-off "Girls Do Toys".**

Currently, the only studios explicitly banned from StashDB for content alone are Girls Do Porn and their spin-off Girls Do Toys. This is due to the [repeated violations of their performers' consent and the resulting legal ramifications](https://www.xbiz.com/news/247515/heres-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-girlsdoporn-case).

While not listed individually here, other scenes and studios that are known to violate the consent of their performers are not allowed anywhere on StashDB and will be rejected or removed. Any scenes or images that are known to include underage performers will also be rejected or removed.

### Amateur Studios
- **Only a limited selection of platforms allowed, with creators used as studios.**

Amateur content is currently allowed on StashDB only in limited circumstances. Content is only allowed from a few platforms (ManyVids, Clips4Sale, PornHub, MFC Share, etc.) and creators who are considered "pro-am" are preferred. Paywalled subscription services like OnlyFans, Just for Fans, and Patreon are not allowed at this time. Content from other platforms may be allowed in the future, but likely also in limited circumstances.

Each creator should be their own studio on StashDB. For example, "Jane Doe" or "Example Productions" would be appropriate names for a studio. This studio will hold scenes produced by the creator across multiple platforms and each scene may contain links to the same video from multiple distributors. Scenes should not be added with just the platform as the studio, for example "PornHub" or "ManyVids" without a creator sub-studio. If the studio does not exist on StashDB yet, it will need to be created. Also note: Studios named after a performer are only used for scenes *released by* that performer. For example: if Jane Doe films a scene for Brazzers Exxtra, that scene will still use "Brazzers Exxtra" as the studio and not "Jane Doe".

For creators that are exclusively on a single platform, the platform may be used as a parent/network studio. For example, if Jane Doe only produces scenes for PornHub then the studio "Jane Doe" can be a sub-studio of "PornHub". If "Jane Doe" scenes are no longer exclusively on PornHub, then PornHub can easily be removed as the parent/network and the studio can be expanded to include other forms of distribution.

Creators must be verified by PornHub for their channel on that platform to be allowed on StashDB. Please see this section dedicated to [adding PornHub scenes]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/scenes/adding-scenes/#pornhub-scenes).

### Animated Studios
- **Only allowed from "professional" studios, not independent content creators.**

Animated content is currently allowed on StashDB only in limited circumstances. Animated scenes are only allowed from what can be considered "professional" studios and not independent content creators. This means they will need a stand-alone website or belong to a larger network. Creators selling animated content through an online marketplace or a subscription service like Patreon are not allowed at this time. The reasoning for this is due to a desire to move slowly with this content, so it may change in the future. A small number of scenes and studios were added prior to this policy's implementation and do not need to be removed at this time, but new scenes and studios will likely be rejected.

_Unconfirmed guideline, subject to change pending formal approval._

### Classic Studios
- **Currently, only scenes available digitally from an official studio website or network are allowed, not including digital marketplaces.**

Older studios are currently allowed on StashDB only in limited circumstances. Studios and scenes that pre-date digital distribution where content is only available as rips of home video releases or third party resellers are not allowed on StashDB at this time. This includes content that can only be sourced from marketplaces that sell digital scenes and movies like Adult DVD Empire or Hot Movies. At this time, all professional scenes and studios must be available digitally from an official studio website or network. The reasoning for this is due to a desire to move slowly with this content, so it may change in the future. Please also see our policy on [full movie scene entries]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/scenes/movies-dvds/#full-dvd-entries).
