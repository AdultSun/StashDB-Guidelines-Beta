### Seasonal Logos
- **Temporary seasonal logos should not be used when a more permanent variation is available.**

Occasionally, studio websites will temporarily change their logo for a particular event or cause. Examples include Halloween, Pride Month, some kind of awareness/fundraising campaign, etc. These temporary logos should not be used as the primary logo on StashDB when a more recent and permanent variation is available. If a non-seasonal image cannot be found on the current studio website, the Wayback Machine and any other external sources should be checked first before using the seasonal variation as a placeholder.
