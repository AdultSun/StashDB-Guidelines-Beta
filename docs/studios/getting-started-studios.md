# **Getting Started: Studios**
{: .no_toc }
The following sections are general advice and explanations for potentially confusing aspects in our database for studios. Because they don't represent explicit decisions concerning database management or curation, they do not require [formal approval]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/getting-started-stashdb/#guideline-proposals).

### Check Duplicate Studios
- **Search using keywords on "Studios" page.**

Before adding a new studio, make sure it doesn't already exist by searching [StashDB's list of studios](https://stashdb.org/studios). Additional search terms will expand the list of results on that page right now, so try to limit yourself to the most unique search term in your studio's name. Also, be aware of our other policies for [adding studios]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/studios/adding-studios/) that may be relevant.

### Studio Edit Comments
- **Say what you're doing, why you're doing it, and what your sources are.**

Regardless of what kind of edit you're submitting, always include in the comment field what you are doing and why. Bigger or more drastic changes will likely require longer comments, but simple changes likely won't need much. Also please remember to note what you are using as the source of your edit when appropriate. These notes will be helpful when considering further edits in addition to justifying your actions now to those who will be voting on it.

### Check Image Size
- **Large images (greater than 1280px in either dimension) are automatically downscaled, which may remove transparency from PNGs.**

Images uploaded to StashDB will be downscaled to no greater than 1280 pixels in either dimension. Due to an old bug, PNGs may be converted to JPGs when downscaling. This means that studio images might lose any transparency they may have if it's over 1280 pixels tall or wide. Until this is fixed, you may need to manually downscale transparent images to fit these size requirements before uploading them to StashDB.
