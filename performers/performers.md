In addition to the sidebar on the right, the links below will take you to the broad categories within the Performers page. Additional links to more specific sections will also be listed after the jump. The **Getting Started** section covers all subjects relating to performers, but is limited to advice and explanations. Firm guidelines that you are expected to follow are instead found in the links directly below it. These cover more specific situations within each subject than the **Getting Started** sections. Breaking them may risk rejected submissions. If you still have any questions, feel free to ask in the **#stashbox-general** or **#ministry-of-truth** channel on Discord.

# Getting Started: Performers
The following sections are general advice and explanations for potentially confusing aspects in our database for performers. Because they don't represent explicit decisions concerning database management or curation, they do not require formal approval.

- **[Handling Ambiguous Performers](#handling-ambiguous-performers)**
  > **Currently, only way is to reassign scenes to disambiguated performers individually.**
- **[Performer Merge Targets](#performer-merge-targets)**
  > **Typically, click "Merge" on the entry with the performer name you'd like to keep.**
- **[Set Performance Aliases on Merge](#set-performance-aliases-on-merge)**
  > **Usually leave box checked unless the merged name is identical to the merge target's name.**
- **[Performer Image Sort Order](#performer-image-sort-order)**
  > **Ranked by size (biggest to smallest), with any horizontal (landscape) images at the end.**
- **[Performer Image Selection](#performer-image-selection)**
  > **Variety is encouraged, allowing for different user preferences and easier identification from throughout a performer's career.**
- **[Performer Edit Comments](#performer-edit-comments)**
  > **Say what you're doing, why you're doing it, and what your sources are.**
- **[Check Suspicious Names and Aliases](#check-suspicious-names-and-aliases)**
  > **Exercise caution with odd looking aliases, particularly those listed on FreeOnes.**
